Digital Elevation Model generation
==================================

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are mandatory inputs for several applications such as interferometry (e.g. ROI_PAC, GMTSAR and Gamma). 

This field guide uses the Developer Cloud Sandbox service to implement an auxilary service to generate DEM taking as input a reference to a SAR product catalogue entry.
