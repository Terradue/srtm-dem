Digital Elevation Model generation
==================================

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are mandatory inputs for several applications such as interferometry (e.g. ROI_PAC, GMTSAR and Gamma). 

This field guide uses the Developer Cloud Sandbox service to implement an auxilary service to generate DEM taking as input a reference to a SAR product catalogue entry.

This work reuses parts of the approach found here: `<http://rnovitsky.blogspot.it/2009/05/howto-create-dem-for-roi-pac-processing.html>`_. We thank `Ran Novitsky Nof <http://www.blogger.com/profile/13547751431352852077>`_ for that!
